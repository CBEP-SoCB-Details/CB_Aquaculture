# Data from 2015.  

These data were retained in CBEP's 2015 State of the Bay Data Archive.
Based on file dates, it appears the data was accessed in  June of 2015, 
but based on data from April of 2015.

This data is in a different format from later years, as point
data includes both LPAs and centroids of conventional leases. LPAs
are indicated with the "L" code under "Lease_Type".
