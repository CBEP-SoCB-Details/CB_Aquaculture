# Data Source for 2017 Data

Data was retained in CBEP Data Archives. These data were used for  preparing 
the 2016 Casco Bay Economic Analysis.

## Shapefiles
Accessed by Curtis C. Bohlen, on or around June 7, 2017 (based on file dates).

Records of original on-line source have been lost, but CCB recalls accessing them 
from an older DMR online data portal.  

# TextFiles
It appears that state-wide geospatial data was accessed initially as a shapefile, then 
separately downloaded as comma delimited text file on July 19, 2017.  The text files
contain a few additional attributes in comparison to the shapefiles.
